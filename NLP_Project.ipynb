They're the only two whale sharks at a North American aquarium .\\nYou can see Ralph and Norton at the world's largest aquarium, the new Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta.\\nThe aquarium's giant tanks hold eight million gallons of water and will be home to about 100,000 fish!\\nThe aquarium was designed to look like a giant ship breaking through the waves.It has 60 different habitats from the sea and five galleries  , each with a different theme.About 2.4 million visitors are expected to come each year. _ \\\" Said Jeff Swanagan, the aquarium's executive director.\\nRalph and Norton arrived in June, 2005 from Taiwan.They were only 15 and 13 feet long, but they may grow to be more than 40 feet long! Whale sharks are the world's largest fish.Three full-time vets will work there to make sure that Ralph, Norton, and all of the aquarium's sea life stay healthy.Students from the University of Georgia will help run the aquarium and conduct research at the animal hospital.\\nThe aquarium was paid for almost completely by a $ 200 million gift from Bemie Marcus, co-founder of Home Depot Inc, and his wife, Billi.\\\"It's going to be the most unique aquarium in the world,\\\" said Marcus.Marcus said the aquarium was a \\\"thank you\\\" note to the city of Atlanta and the State of Georgia, where the Home Depot first opened for business.\",\n          \"Question: What is more astonishing than a 60-ton whale on a flatbed truck being driven down the street?\\nAnswer: A 60-ton whale on a flatbed truck exploding and raining blubber ( fat of whales) all over the sidewalk.\\nThat's what happened in Taiwan recently, when a dead sperm whale being shipped to the Halobios Research Center for an autopsy  developed an extremely bad case of gas and blew up before it reached its destination.\\nThe whale was found alive on a prefix = st1 /Taiwanbeach last weekend, and died shortly after it was discovered. Since the 56-foot whale was the largest whale ever beached onTaiwan's shores, scientists wanted to study it and perform an autopsy for educational purpose.\\nObviously, too much time passed between when the animal died and the time it was set to be moved to the autopsy location, because it had already started to go bad. When things rot, they give off gases as a by-product. In the whale's case, the gases were trapped in its belly. The pressure inside the rotting creature grew so much that it popped like an over-filled balloon. Unfortunately, it was on a truck in the middle of the city of Taiwanat the time--- cars and shops lining the street were covered with whale bits and juices, much to their owners' discouragement.\\nAccording to the news reports, traffic was tied up for hours while officials tried to clean up the streets.\\nNewspaper editors worldwide were probably smiling to themselves, since they had a ready-made headline--- several reports about the incident were titled \\\" There She Blows!\\\" after the famous line from the book Moby Dick.\",\n          \"If you have a problem with speaking, you can do several things. Listen to English as much as possible. You can learn a poem  or a song by heart. You can also learn more dialogues . And practice speaking with your friends as much as you can.\\nMany people find it difficult to listen to English. The answer is to listen as much as you can. However, don't do too much at one time. It is better to practice listening for five minutes every day. Don't sit down and listen for an hour at a time. That's too much! Do choose listening passages that are interesting and not too difficult. Choose  tapes  on which the people speak clearly and not too fast. Take it easy, at first. Success with simple tapes at the beginning is the answer. Later on you can practice with tapes that are more difficult.\\nFinally, how can you learn to write well? How do you use little words like in, on, of and for? There are two answers to this. First, do some study with new words. Keep a list of verbs like look for, look after and so on. Second, read as much English as possible. There are many things that can't be learnt. You must see them in books many times. Then you'll be able to use them correctly  yourself. So, in order to write well, you must first learn to read much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"D\",\n          \"A\",\n          \"C\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 72439,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The writer takes Tippy as a good example to_.\",\n          \"What does Para. 4 mainly talk about?\",\n          \"According to the passage, people like to download music largely because   _  .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"options\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

He was only three when he flooded the kitchen.\\n      His mother, Angela Brown is very busy looking after her new baby, a little girl called Laura, as well as Daniel. She told us, \\\"Daniel is so full of curiosity  .\\\" At that moment, we hear a loud noise and then silence. We go upstairs and find Daniel getting out of a wardrobe which he has pulled over onto the floor, with a book in his hand. \\\"It's for you, Mum,\\\" he says and looks up at his mum and smiles. Seven-year-old Daniel has a lovely face. He has golden hair, big brown eyes, and a friendly smile. I have to admit that Daniel doesn't look like a naughty boy.\\n      Angela told me all about it, \\\"Once I found him as he was about to put Jasper in the washing machine.\\\" Jasper, she explained, is the Browns' dog. \\\"When I asked him why, he said that he thought Jasper was dirty! It's amazing how one little boy can cause so much trouble. Another time he cut off all the hair of the little girl next door. She was going to attend her sister's wedding and the neighbors haven't spoken to us since.\\\"\\n      Angela told me about Daniel's most expensive crime. \\\"I was about to do the washing up when the baby started crying. Daniel decided to help and filled the kitchen sink with water. When I came in, the water was already flooding the kitchen and was about to flood the hall. The carpet was ruined and had to be replaced. I hope things will get better as he gets older.\\\"\\n      Amazingly, Daniel is quite well behaved in school. This may be because he is seldom bored. Meanwhile he continues to be the naughtiest little boy in England. Will his baby sister Laura grow up to be the naughtiest little girl?\",\n          \"WASHINGTON -- President Obama and his wife, Michelle, handed out Halloween treats to area children and military families at the White House Sunday evening.\\nLocal students between 6 and 14 years old, along with children from military families, were invited to celebrate Halloween on the North Lawn.\\nThe president and first lady, along with Mrs.Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, spent about 30 minutes passing out goodie bags.Obama wished each child a happy Halloween as he distributed the treats, pausing occasionally for hugs or to comment on costumes.\\nLater, the military families continued the celebration inside the White House.\\nThe first couple joked to assembled reporters about children walking the long driveway in order to work off   the snacks.\\\"This is the Let's Move method of trick-or-treating  ,\\\" Obama said, referring to Mrs.Obama's campaign to combat childhood obesity  .\\nThe goodie bags contained a box of White House M&Ms, a cookie made by pastry chef   Bill Yosses, and dried fruit.\\nAs they made their way across the lawn, the children meet a vast range of costumed characters ranging from a spooky Frankenstein (,<<>> ) to the Scarecrow from \\\"The Wizard of Oz.\\\" Music from a jazz band dressed in pirate gear rang out across the White House grounds.\\nMulticolored pumpkins and gourds lined the driveway -- individually, in gravity-defying stacks and as part of a large mound over 5 feet tall.Pumpkin-headed scarecrows   made of cornstalks loomed over the path with menacingly raised arms.Under the White House portico, a mobile resembling bats flying through clouds fluttered around a lantern.\\nSome of the local trick-or-treaters were students at Bancroft Elementary, which helps tend the first lady's White House garden, and Tubman Elementary, which has a relationship with the White House chefs.\\nAfter trick-or-treating ended, the Obamas stood near the front door, welcoming the military families inside, helping children climb the short flight of steps and thanking parents for their service.\",\n          \"Have you ever heard of a great Chilean poet? He was once referred to as the _ of poetry. Beloved by Chileans of all classes, he is one of the most widely read and respected poets in history. And this year is the 110th birthday of Pablo Neruda (1904-1973).\\nBorn with the name Neftali Ricardo Reyes Basolto, he was a tall, shy and lonely boy. He loved to read and started to write poetry when he was ten. The American poet Walt Whitman, whose framed picture Neruda later kept on his table, became a major influence on his work.\\nHowever, his father did not like the idea of having a poet for a son and tried to discourage him from writing. To cover up the publication of his first poem, he took the pen name Pablo Neruda.\\nIn 1924 Neruda gained fame with his most widely read work \\\"Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair''. Yet his rich experience as a diplomat and exile made him go beyond the theme of love. His work also reflected the political struggle of the left and development of South America. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971.\\nNeruda loved the sea which he saw as creative, destructive and forever moving. He found inspiration in the power and freedom of the waves and the seabirds on the coast. \\\"I need the sea because it teaches me,\\\" he wrote. \\\"I move in the university of the waves.\\\" He loved how the sea forever renewed itself, a renewal echoed   in his work.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"D\",\n          \"B\",\n          \"C\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 80134,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"What does the author say about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa?\",\n          \"What does Jane usually do after supper?\",\n          \"What does the writer discuss in this passage?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"options\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"article_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 576,\n        \"min\": 9,\n        \"max\": 6437,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2968,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3381,\n          857,\n          3397\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

They're the only two whale sharks at a North American aquarium .\\nYou can see Ralph and Norton at the world's largest aquarium, the new Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta.\\nThe aquarium's giant tanks hold eight million gallons of water and will be home to about 100,000 fish!\\nThe aquarium was designed to look like a giant ship breaking through the waves.It has 60 different habitats from the sea and five galleries  , each with a different theme.About 2.4 million visitors are expected to come each year. _ \\\" Said Jeff Swanagan, the aquarium's executive director.\\nRalph and Norton arrived in June, 2005 from Taiwan.They were only 15 and 13 feet long, but they may grow to be more than 40 feet long! Whale sharks are the world's largest fish.Three full-time vets will work there to make sure that Ralph, Norton, and all of the aquarium's sea life stay healthy.Students from the University of Georgia will help run the aquarium and conduct research at the animal hospital.\\nThe aquarium was paid for almost completely by a $ 200 million gift from Bemie Marcus, co-founder of Home Depot Inc, and his wife, Billi.\\\"It's going to be the most unique aquarium in the world,\\\" said Marcus.Marcus said the aquarium was a \\\"thank you\\\" note to the city of Atlanta and the State of Georgia, where the Home Depot first opened for business.\",\n          \"Question: What is more astonishing than a 60-ton whale on a flatbed truck being driven down the street?\\nAnswer: A 60-ton whale on a flatbed truck exploding and raining blubber ( fat of whales) all over the sidewalk.\\nThat's what happened in Taiwan recently, when a dead sperm whale being shipped to the Halobios Research Center for an autopsy  developed an extremely bad case of gas and blew up before it reached its destination.\\nThe whale was found alive on a prefix = st1 /Taiwanbeach last weekend, and died shortly after it was discovered. Since the 56-foot whale was the largest whale ever beached onTaiwan's shores, scientists wanted to study it and perform an autopsy for educational purpose.\\nObviously, too much time passed between when the animal died and the time it was set to be moved to the autopsy location, because it had already started to go bad. When things rot, they give off gases as a by-product. In the whale's case, the gases were trapped in its belly. The pressure inside the rotting creature grew so much that it popped like an over-filled balloon. Unfortunately, it was on a truck in the middle of the city of Taiwanat the time--- cars and shops lining the street were covered with whale bits and juices, much to their owners' discouragement.\\nAccording to the news reports, traffic was tied up for hours while officials tried to clean up the streets.\\nNewspaper editors worldwide were probably smiling to themselves, since they had a ready-made headline--- several reports about the incident were titled \\\" There She Blows!\\\" after the famous line from the book Moby Dick.\",\n          \"If you have a problem with speaking, you can do several things. Listen to English as much as possible. You can learn a poem  or a song by heart. You can also learn more dialogues . And practice speaking with your friends as much as you can.\\nMany people find it difficult to listen to English. The answer is to listen as much as you can. However, don't do too much at one time. It is better to practice listening for five minutes every day. Don't sit down and listen for an hour at a time. That's too much! Do choose listening passages that are interesting and not too difficult. Choose  tapes  on which the people speak clearly and not too fast. Take it easy, at first. Success with simple tapes at the beginning is the answer. Later on you can practice with tapes that are more difficult.\\nFinally, how can you learn to write well? How do you use little words like in, on, of and for? There are two answers to this. First, do some study with new words. Keep a list of verbs like look for, look after and so on. Second, read as much English as possible. There are many things that can't be learnt. You must see them in books many times. Then you'll be able to use them correctly  yourself. So, in order to write well, you must first learn to read much.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"D\",\n          \"A\",\n          \"C\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 72439,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The writer takes Tippy as a good example to_.\",\n          \"What does Para. 4 mainly talk about?\",\n          \"According to the passage, people like to download music largely because   _  .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"options\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

By changing the activity of the cells they were able to change the behaviour of risk-taking rats to avoid risk, hinting the approach could in future be used to treat people with impulse   control problems.\\nRisk-taking is a key part of survival, knowing when to take a chance could pay off--such as moving to a new area to look for food when pickings are slim.\\nWhile all animals need an element of risk, the preference towards it varies between individuals. Researchers found this variation, which determines how risk-averse an individual is, is regulated by brain cells in a region of the brain called the nucleus accumbens. This cluster of neurons releases the neurotransmitter dopamine, which regulates the brain's reward and pleasure centres.\\nPrevious studies have shown that in patients with Parkinson's disease, taking medication which blocks specific dopamine receptors (DR2)   leads to increased gambling   behaviour and risk taking behaviour. In studies with rats, researchers were able to use a technique called optogenetics  --which uses light sensitive proteins to change the activity of cells--to modify cells with DR2 in the nucleus accumbens.\\nRats were trained to choose one of two levers, offering them a choice between a \\\"safe\\\" or \\\"risky\\\" choice. The safe option resulted in a small, but consistent amount of a sugar water treat. But the risky choice consistently delivered smaller amounts of sugar water, with the occasional large pay off--essentially encouraging the animals to gamble for a bigger prize. Around two-thirds of the animals weren't keen on risk, opting for the safe option, but the remaining third were risk-seekers. Brain scans of the animals showed that those with low levels of DR2 consistently went for the gamble.\\nBut using pulses of light to stimulate   the DR2 cells and improve their activity could cause the risk-takers to play it safe and opt for the guaranteed but less rewarding option. Once the light-pulses stopped, the risk-takers returned to their gambling strategy.\\nIn the _ , stimulating the same cells had little to no effect.\\nProfessor Karl Deisseroth, of Stanford University in California, said: \\\"Humans and rats have similar brain structures involved.\\\"And we found a drug known to increase risk preference in people had the same effect on the rats. So every indication is that these findings are relevant to humans. \\\"Risky behavior has its moments where it' s valuable. As a species, we wouldn't have come as far as we have without it.\\\"\",\n          \"A month after Hurricane Katrina, I returned home in New Orleans. There lay my house, reduced towaist-high ruins, smelly and dirty.\\nBefore the trip, I'd had my car fixed. When the office employee of the garage was writing up the bill,she noticed my Louisiana license plate. \\\"You from New Orleans?\\\"she asked I said I was, \\\"No charge.\\\"She said, and firmly shook her head when I reached for my wallet. The next day I went for a haircut, and the same thing happened.\\nAs my wife was studying in Florida, we decided to move there and tried to find a rental house that we could afford while also paying off a mortgage (> on our mined house. We looked at many places, but none was satisfactory. We'd began to accept that we*d have to live in extremely reduced circumstances for a while, when I got a very curious e-mail from a James Kemmedy in California. He'd read some pieces I'd written about our sufferings for State, the online magazine  and wanted to give us (\\\"\\\"no conditions attached')a new house across thelake from New Orleans.\\nIt sounded too good to be true, but I replied, thanking him for his exceptional generosity, that we had no plan to go back. Then a poet at the University of Florida offered to let his house to me, while he went to England on his one-year paid leave. The rent was rather reasonable. I mentioned the poet's offer to James Kemdedy, and the next day he sent a check covering our entire rent for eight months.\\nThroughout this painful experience, the kindness of strangers has done much to bring back my faith in humanity. It's almost worth losing your worldly possessions to be reminded that people are really nice when given half a chance.\",\n          \"The crow  is an ordinary  bird. It is about twenty inches  long and black all over. Crows are dirty birds because they live on old bad food. Crows eat a lot of waste food. In this way they are more useful to us than any birds. They clean up the dirty things in our streets. Crows are always hungry. They look for food all day long, and in the evening you can see them in large numbers flying back to their nests  in the trees. They sleep there at night.\\nCrows are much noisier than other birds. Very often a large number of crows will get together on one house and talk. Sometimes they talk together, and sometimes they do it by turns like human beings . It is easy to tell from  crows' sounds whether they are pleased or angry. Perhaps crows talk a lot because they are friendly birds. A pair of crows will live together all their lives, and if one of them dies, the other one becomes very sad and quiet for the rest of its life and sometimes it dies, too.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4491,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Less than a year after turning professional.Tiger Woods\",\n          \"To make yourself a \\\"true photographer\\\",you   _  .\",\n          \"The text is mainly about   _  .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"option\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 18629,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Everyone's life is interesting.\",\n          \"established in national park\",\n          \"persuade foreigners to buy all of them\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
