Many people search for various ways to relieve their pain. Experts sometimes suggest yoga to bring pain relief. According to a research study conducted by Harvard Health Publications, several studies showed that yoga, a mind-body exercise, helped people who had back pain. The people who joined the experiment and regularly practiced yoga for several months experienced less pain. Yoga can also help people who have arthritis. In a small study, people who had arthritis who practiced yoga modified for their condition experienced less pain and better mood than a control group who didn't practice it.

Yoga achieves pain-relieving effects through many ways. First, yoga helps people relax their tension. When people are under stress, their muscles become tight, which can lead to pain. Yoga focuses on breathing and encourages relaxation, this significantly relieves muscle tension. Second, it helps make people move more and reduce the stiffness. Stretching helps improve blood circulation, this encourages nutrients flow into tissues and waste products from tissues. Yoga movements are usually gentle, which makes it ideal for people who experience pain.
